## myGit

Welcome!In this project, I build a small-scale implementation of Git to understand the inner workings of this popular version control system. This implementation focuses on initializing repositories, creating commits, and cloning public repositories, providing insight into Git's `.git` directory structure, object storage, and transfer protocols.

## Overview

This project includes a minimalistic version of Git capable of performing the following operations:
- **Initialize a Repository**: Create a new Git repository with the necessary directories and files.
- **Create Commits**: Create commits with tree and blob objects, emulating the core functionality of Git.
- **Clone Public Repositories**: Clone public repositories, including fetching objects and references.

## Features

- **Repository Initialization**: Set up a new Git repository with `.git` directory and subdirectories for objects and references.
- **Object Storage**: Handle Git objects, including blobs (file contents), trees (directory listings), and commits (snapshots of the project).
- **Commit Creation**: Create commits with a message and parent commit reference, including author and committer information.
- **Cloning**: Clone public repositories by fetching references and objects from a remote server.

This Project is build during an online Challenge 'Build Your own x'
